These are services and applications a dev on the team needs to have to support
our operations.

# Github

All developers need a github profile handle with a public key to push and pull code to our two Princeton github communities. SSH Access to all servers is also through the use of this public key. 

# Princeton SSO Account (i.e. DUO, Your University Account, the netid account)
* University Email (Set-up via Campus HR Onboarding)
* VPN (GlobalProtect Client) -- [procedure here under "Installing GlobalProtect Software"](https://workcontinuity.princeton.edu/remoteaccess)
* Google Drive (student developers already have an account; staff should [follow these instructions](https://princeton.service-now.com/service/kb_search.do?id=1111))
* Libanswers https://princeton.libapps.com/ (Patron facing tickets) - Kevin can grant access (student developers can skip this)
* SN@P (Staff facing tickets) - Request access from Tracy Hall in Operations (student developers can skip this)
* Approvals (Library Travel Requests) - account created automatically
* Lastpass (need to be added to various Shared ITIMS folders once an account exists - https://informationsecurity.princeton.edu/LastPass)

# Externally Hosted Catalog Related Applications

# Atlas Systems Applications

Staff clients for all three of these Atlas systems. They are accessible only via Windows Remote Desktop when connected to following designated machines lib-ares-cli1, lib-ares-cli2. An account for a dev will need to be created manually in each of the three systems. Students can skip this.
