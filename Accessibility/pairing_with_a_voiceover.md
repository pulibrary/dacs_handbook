### Pairing with VoiceOver

VoiceOver testing as a pair is a good way to share knowledge and uncover issues that a single team member might miss.  Here are some tips:

#### For the driver

* When you share your screen, make sure that the "Share sound" checkbox is checked.
* If you were previously sharing your screen without sharing sound, you can add it by:
    * Pressing the "New Share" button
    * Activating the "Share sound" checkbox
* Make sure that the speech speed is comfortable for everyone on the call.  You can increase or decrease the
  speed by:
   1. Go to System Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Open VoiceOver Utility > Speech.
   2. Choose a new rate option.  Christina and Jane find 40 to be a good rate for pairing.
* To avoid interruptions from zoom chats, you may choose to edit your Zoom screen reader settings.  To do this:
    * Open the menu near the "Show Captions" button
    * Select "Caption Settings"
    * Scroll down to the "Screen Reader Alerts" section
    * Uncheck the "In-meeting Chat Received" options

#### For the navigator

* Avoid using the zoom chat.  Depending on the driver's zoom settings, a chat message can interrupt what VoiceOver was reading so that it can read the chat message instead.
