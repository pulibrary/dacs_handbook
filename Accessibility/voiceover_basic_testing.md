# Testing a page using VoiceOver

1. Open the page you'd like to test in Safari, rather
than Firefox or Chrome.  The combination
of VoiceOver and Firefox, in particular, can be buggy.
1. Turn on Voiceover.  There are several ways to do this:
   1. Press Command + F5, or
   1. System Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver, or
   1. Ask Siri to do it :-)
1. Press Control + Option + U to pull up the rotor.  Use the
arrow keys to confirm that all the headings, links, forms, tables,
and landmarks are as you expect.
1. Use the rotor to navigate to the specific area that you'd like
to test.
1. Use these keyboard shortcuts to navigate and interact with the
area you are testing:

| Shortcut | Meaning |
|---|---|
|Control + Option + A | Start reading |
|Control | Stop reading |
|Control + Option + Right | Go to the next item |
|Control + Option + Left | Go to the previous item |
|Control + Option + H | Open the VoiceOver help |
