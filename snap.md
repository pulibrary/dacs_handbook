SNAP (Service Now At Princeton) is the college's ticket system.  The default notifications can be quite overwhelming.

To reduce the notifications to just the relevant ones:

1. Go to My Notification Preferences on the left sidebar
1. On the intake tab, turn off "Intake assigned to group"
1. On the incident task tab, turn off everything except "Incident task assigned to you"

If you are trying to track down a SNAP form, the request catalog can be helpful.
