# Team Work Cycles

We currently alternate between two types of work cycles

## Feature Work Cycles

Duration: One Week

These include prioritized feature and substantive bug fix work on existing projects. Also used for kicking off "new" projects. Active tickets for these weeks come from the "Ready" or "In Progress" columns on the board. 

## Maintenance Work Cycles 

Duration: One Week 

Covers prioritized work tagged with the "maintainence" badge on our zenhub board. These cycles include coverage of dependabot alerts, other priority security patches, and major/minor version upgrade work. We typically will conduct re-indexes of Orangelight during designated maintainence weeks.
