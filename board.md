# Board

Our team tracks our work on our [Zenhub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/feature-work-cycle-board-571691cab409d8d821b873be/board).

## Story points

When using Epic tickets do not actually assign points to the ticket itself, Epics are the sum of the points of their assigned individual tickets. 

| Number of points | Meaning |
|---|---|
|1 point|A small amount of time|
|2 points|1/2 day|
|3 points|1 day|
|5 points|2-3 days|
|8 points|1 week|
|13 points|Needs to be broken down into smaller tickets|
