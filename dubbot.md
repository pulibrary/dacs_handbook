# Dubbot

## Accessing dubbot

1. Go to https://princeton.dubbot.com
1. Select the group "Discovery & Access Services"


## Crawling

By default, dubbot crawls the catalog every 90 days.  However, we can reach out to John Jameson or Rachel Busnardo to crawl more frequently, or to do an ad-hoc crawl.

If there is one specific page, we'd like to check again, we can open it in dubbot and press the "Crawl" button.  It may spin forever, but if you reload the page, it should show you the new results.

## Resolving issues and opening tasks

You can resolve an issue, but if the issue appears on the next crawl, dubbot will flag it again.

If you need more information about a particular issue, you can:
1. Open a task, assign John and Rachel, and then type your question.

## Email notifications

By default, you will recieve email notifications about any project you have permissions to,
including projects that are not in the DACS portfolio.  To reduce noise from other projects,
set up your email notifications to only include DACS projects:

1. Go to [DubBot](https://princeton.dubbot.com/)
2. Press your initials (or photo) in the top right corner to open the profile menu.
3. Press the "Profile" menu option
4. Open the "Notification Settings" tab
5. Note that "Email about all sites that I have permission to" is set to Yes.
6. Instead of "Yes", select "Filter to only email crawl finished reports for selected Sites"
7. Press the "Select Sites" button
8. Select the sites in the DACS portfolio.
9. Press the Save button at the top of the screen to save these sites.
10. Press the Save button at the bottom of the screen to save your notification preferences.
