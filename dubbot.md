# Dubbot

## Accessing dubbot

1. Go to https://princeton.dubbot.com
1. Select the group "Discovery & Access Services"


## Crawling

By default, dubbot crawls the catalog every 90 days.  However, we can reach out to John Jameson or Rachel Busnardo to crawl more frequently, or to do an ad-hoc crawl.

If there is one specific page, we'd like to check again, we can open it in dubbot and press the "Crawl" button.  It may spin forever, but if you reload the page, it should show you the new results.

## Resolving issues and opening tasks

You can resolve an issue, but if the issue appears on the next crawl, dubbot will flag it again.

If you need more information about a particular issue, you can:
1. Open a task, assign John and Rachel, and then type your question.
