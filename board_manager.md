# Board Manager

The board manager role switches off between team members at the beginning of each week.  Make sure that the board manager is aware of their role on the Friday prior to the start of the next work week. Ideally the board manager should be somebody who is planning to be in for the whole week. 

## Duties

1. Run the DACS work cycle board during team check-ins and planning meeting during the course of the week. 
2. Deploy all current [DACS applications](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJZ6CE4yq4EyaoeOE__bjEYPUv5xlZVM0bPKfyVAUQw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) marked in "Active" or "Active Maintenance" in both their staging and production enviroments. Create tickets accordingly if any deployments fail.
