#  Discovery and ACcess Services (DACS)

## Responsibilities of the team

### Reporting Structure
We are one of three development teams in Library IT Reporting to Esme Cowles. The other two teams are:
* Digital Library Services https://github.com/pulibrary/dls-handbook
* Research Data and Scholarship Services https://github.com/pulibrary/rdss-handbook

### Responsibilities 
The Team is responsible for the discovery systems, web sites, business applications and data management for the library. We all work remotely at least two days per week. We have daily check-ins to stay connected, with a longer check-in to plan our work for the week. Although, because we are customer focused our priorities may shift throughout the week. We also have regular standing check-ins with other teams throughout the library.

The Team collaborates closely with the three staff members who manage our Alma platform to support the integrations (indexing, availability, requesting) within the Library Catalog, as well as supporting the code that facilitates the movement data in and out of Alma related to patron and financial information.

### Technology
The Team works on many applications utilizing Ruby, Rails, Drupal, Solr, and some legacy applications that we are working to phase out. We have been developing any new applications in Ruby or Rails. We also utilize ansible for spinning up our infrastructure.

## High Visibility Projects:
The Library Catalog (https://catalog.princeton.edu/) supports access to bibliographic material that the library owns or has access to. We made many updates during the start of the pandemic to allow the Princeton users access to materials that the Princeton Library owns without needing to be physically present; For example Controlled Digital Lending (CDL), which allows students access to online copies of physical material for their classes.

We have Drupal websites that allow content editors and Librarians to post new information for the library users and also serve as the primary access point to Library services and subscription electronic resources. These sites range from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9. These include the Library's core website: https://library.princeton.edu/. 

In addition we support many websites that utilize various technologies.
