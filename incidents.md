### Incident response

If an application is down, performance is seriously degraded,
a severe security vulnerability is discovered, or another
incident occurs that requires the team's immediate attention:

1. Create a zoom link
1. Post it to the #incident_reports slack channel
1. Developers and folks from the Ops team who are available will join the zoom
1. Keep in mind that we have documented troubleshooting procedures for [orangelight](https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/wiki/Trouble-Shooting-Orangelight) and the [library website](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul_library_drupal/wiki/Trouble-Shooting-Library-Website).
1. For major outages, create an informative, blame-free [post-mortem report](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1EImhSsuZGQb2VNW2ELLTWrVPWoqdFAg1)
