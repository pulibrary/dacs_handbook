# Boards

Our team uses several zenhub boards:
* [Feature cycle](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/feature-work-cycle-board-571691cab409d8d821b873be/board)
* [Drupal and PHP](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/drupal-and-php-62754d9e00fb43001116d7a4/board)
* [DACS Maintenance](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/dacs-maintenance-5da0db919c4ddf0001b2eb92/board?filterLogic=any&labels=maintenance,dependencies)

Here are some typical columns you will see on these boards:

| Column | Meaning  |
|---|---|
| Icebox | Items that are not currently a high priority |
| Ready  | Items that are of a high priority and are ready to be worked on  |
| Blocked | Items that are blocked |
