Records in Contexts ("RiC") is the new international descriptive standard for archives. It consists of a conceptual model and an owl ontology. 
While the ontology is itself just one of many possible implementations, RiC assumes implementation as linked data.

Adoption of Records in Contexts by PUL and/or the community will mean significant changes to the data structures and infrastructure involved. 
We don't yet know how all of that will shake out (and in particular the role that ArchivesSpace will play in it), but we can probably anticipate an 
RDF serialization and triplestore or wikibase being involved.

There is no open-source content management application yet that supports Records in Contexts. For this experiment, we can use this wiki-cloud implementation of the 
Records in Contexts conceptual model to explore how the record structure will change and what it would take to get collection-level records out of a 
wikibase and into bibdata.

The wikibase currently defines the first- (Wikidata) and second-level (RiC) entities and properties. I'm working with the SAA Description Section on 
making this wikibase available to the archives community for test-driving RiC.
